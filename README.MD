You can visualize each subscribed `SSO Listener` and raise events directly from editor.
The `- button` allows you to unsubscribe the relative gameobject.

## **ðŸ’¡ Listeners**
---
Listeners are MonoBehaviours that will react when a SSO Event is raised.

In order to use them you need to add a `SSO Listener` Component to your gameobject.
once added, you can select the `SSO Event` you want this GameObject to listen to and trigger the `Unity Event` in it's component.

You can raise events in the editor as long and you have `Editor and Runtime` selected in the component.
